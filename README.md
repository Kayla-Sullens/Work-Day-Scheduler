# Work-Day-Scheduler


## Description

For this challenge assignment, we were given starter code for a work-day scheduler that we had to improve on and fix a few things. In JavaScript, I was able to add an event listner to the save button that would save text entered into local storage. I also wrote a couple of functions to have the time blocks change color based on whether they are past, present, or future and to have data stored in local storage. Then I was able to have that text/data pulled from local storage to display on the page once refreshed. This is the piece I struggled with most and spent several hours on and got help with. I understood what I needed to do, but struggled to make it happen.
